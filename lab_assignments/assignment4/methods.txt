The gff of Sorghum genome annotations was first processed using gffread to create a .gtf file suitable for index construction.
STAR was used to create an index from this file and the Sorghum reference genome fasta file.
STAR was then used to align the paired end reads from each of the SRR files to the genome, with the output set to be sorted .bam files.
The unpaired reads left by trimming elimination of their companions were aligned with STAR using the methods intended for single end reads.
All necessary alignment statistics were extracted from the .Log.final.out files produced by STAR. 
A high percentage of unique alignments was observed across all files.
