The final .bam file from the previous lab assignment was used as an input file for the picard MarkDuplicates function.
This function was called as gatk MarkDuplicates with output to marked_duplicates.bam file and metrics to a new .txt file. 
This was all performed in a shell script submitted to the queue due to performance constraints in the development environments.
head was used to print the first lines of the .txt file to the terminal, where they were screenshotted.
Read Groups were then added to the .bam file using gatk AddOrReplaceReadGroups with input marked_duplicates.bam, 
output ReadGroupsDone.bam, and other settings -RGID 1 -RGLB lib1 -RGPL ILLUMINA -RGPU NA -RGSM WS2
To facilitate the use of the genome fasta file as a reference for variant calling, samtools faidx was used to make an index from the fasta.
For the same reason a dictionary .dict file for the genome fasta was made using gatk CreateSequenceDictionary.
A shell script running gatk --java-options "-Xmx4g" HaplotypeCaller with ReadGroupsDone.bam as an input, 
outputting to a new .vcf file, with the genome fasta file as a reference was written and submitted to the queue.
head was used to print the first lines of the .vcf file to the terminal, where they were screenshotted.
