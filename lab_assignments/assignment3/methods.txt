Trimmomatic SE was used with the arguments TRAILING:29 and MINLEN:90 to trim the reads. 
The trailing ends were trimmed with a threshold of 29 as previous analysis indicated that this would remove many of the lowest quality bases from the trailing end.
The minimum length was set to 90 as the typical reads were ~200 bp and any read in which more than half of the bases were removed would necessarily be very low quality.
In practice few or no reads were eliminated by the MINLEN operation.
fastqc was used to create html quality control reports for each file.
These reports indicated a general improvement in trailing end quality, with a moderate shortening of reads compared to the untrimmed files.
