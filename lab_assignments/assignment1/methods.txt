Genome files, assembly and annotation for the Sorghum bicolor v3.1.1 genome, were downloaded from the Phytozome database in a zipped folder.
The folder was unzipped using Microsoft File Explorer, due to my greater familiarity with its tools.
The files, gzipped FASTA and .gff files, were uploaded to the HPCC using the MobaXterm interface.
The files were unzipped using the gunzip command and the first 10 lines were printed using the head command.

RNA sequence files for sorghum accession PRJNA319738, genotype IS22330, were downloaded as .fastq files using the sratoolkit prefetch and fastq-dump commands. 
The first 10 lines of one .fastq file were printed using the head command.
