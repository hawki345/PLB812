Count tables were prepared from the alignment files using htseq-count, 
with the -r set to pos as the alignment is sorted by position, 
the -c set to output counts to a .tsv file, 
and -s set to no as the data is unstranded.
The six count tables were placed in a folder within the working directory for R.
A sample table was made for the DESeq2 R package along with their condition information, three drought stress and three well-watered samples.
The sample table and directory of count tables were read into a DESeq dataset with a one factor model based on condition.
The condition factor was releveled to set "WW" for well watered as the reference.
The dataset was filtered to remove all genes with less than 10 total transcripts.
Size factors for each sample were estimated and printed out.
 WW_1      WW_2      WW_3      DS_1      DS_2      DS_3 
1.0061538 1.0241568 1.0963219 1.0015613 1.1317504 0.8379209 
Dispersions were estimated using the estimateDispersions function and then plotted.
The variance stabilizing transform was used on the dataset and used to make a sample distribution matrix which was used to plot a heatmap.
The variance stabilized data was used for a PCA analysis, which revealed that the two conditions did not cluster closely or precisely.
A negative binomial Wald test was performed on the dataset to call differential gene expression.
The genes that were differentially expressed with an adjusted p value of <0.05 were counted.
There were 191 genes that were differentially expressed at a 95% significance level between the drought stressed and well watered samples.
