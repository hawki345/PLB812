The 12 fastq files downloaded in the previous lab assignment were used in this assignment.
conda install was used to install fastqc on the hpcc cluster
A shell script was written using the vim text editor, using the first lines to set the time, job name, and required resources.
conda was added to the path as shown in the example script to enable use of the fastqc module
A new directory was created to receive the html files outputted by fastqc.
fastqc was used on all 12 fastq files, setting output to the new directory.
However, due to an unknown issue, while the files were successfully created they were not placed in the correct directory.
